# Design Patterns

A repository to use as a cheatsheet for all Design Patterns defined by the "Gang of Four"(Gof) in 1994\
For each design you are going to find a section with a summary explanation.\
Every design pattern has its pros and cons.\
Use cases are also defined for each pattern.\
A design pattern is basically a recipe to solve specific problem.

            <ul>
                <li>It provides an interface for creating objects in superclass, but allow children to alter the type of objects that will be created</li>
                <li>Use when the type of the objects are not known beforehand</li>
                <li>Use when the program is meant to be extende by its clients</li>
                <li>Use when the program should save resources by reusing existing objects</li>
                <li>Pros: Avoid tight coupling. Respects Single Responsability and Open/Closed Principles</li>
                <li>Cons: A lot of new classes are added</li>
            </ul>
