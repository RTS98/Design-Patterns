# Design Patterns

A repository to use as a cheatsheet for all Design Patterns defined by the "Gang of Four"(Gof) in 1994\
For each design you are going to find a section with a summary explanation.\
Every design pattern has its pros and cons.\
Use cases are also defined for each pattern.\
A design pattern is basically a recipe to solve specific problem.
